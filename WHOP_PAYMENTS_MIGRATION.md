# Migration from Stripe to Whop Integrated Payments

**Date:** October 24, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Complete

---

## Overview

Community Vault has been successfully migrated from Stripe payments to **Whop's integrated payment system**. This provides a seamless, native payment experience within the Whop ecosystem.

---

## What Changed

### Removed
- ❌ Stripe SDK (`stripe` npm package)
- ❌ Stripe-specific environment variables (`STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`)
- ❌ `/api/stripe/webhook` endpoint (renamed)

### Added
- ✅ Whop Checkout SDK integration
- ✅ `/api/whop/webhook` endpoint for payment events
- ✅ Native Whop payment flow using existing authentication

---

## Updated Files

### Core Payment Logic
**File:** `lib/payments.ts`

**Changes:**
- Replaced `Stripe` SDK with `@whop/api` SDK
- Updated `createCheckoutSession()` to use Whop checkout API
- Replaced `handleStripeWebhook()` with `handleWhopWebhook()`
- Added support for `payment.succeeded` and `membership.created` events
- Uses Whop user IDs for proper user association

### Webhook Handler
**File:** `app/api/whop/webhook/route.ts` (formerly `app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts`)

**Changes:**
- Updated signature verification to use Whop's HMAC-SHA256 method
- Changed header from `stripe-signature` to `x-whop-signature`
- Updated to use `WHOP_SIGNING_SECRET` environment variable

### Configuration Files
**Files:** `.env.example`, `package.json`, `README.md`, `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`

**Changes:**
- Removed Stripe-related environment variables
- Updated documentation to reference Whop payments
- Removed `stripe` dependency from package.json

---

## Environment Variables

### Removed Variables
```bash
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY="sk_test_..."
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET="whsec_..."
```

### Existing Variables (No Changes Required)
```bash
# Whop configuration (already in use)
NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_APP_ID="app_xxxxx"
WHOP_SERVER_API_KEY="whop_api_key_xxxxx"
WHOP_SIGNING_SECRET="whop_webhook_signing_secret"

# Revenue splits (unchanged)
CREATOR_SPLIT_PERCENT="0.89"
COMMUNITY_SPLIT_PERCENT="0.10"
PLATFORM_SPLIT_PERCENT="0.01"

# Whop checkout URL (optional)
WHOP_CHECKOUT_URL="https://whop.com/checkout"
```

---

## Whop Checkout Integration Details

### How It Works

1. **User Initiates Purchase**
   - User clicks "Purchase" on a premium file
   - Frontend calls `POST /api/checkout` with `fileId`

2. **Checkout Session Created**
   ```typescript
   const checkout = await whop.checkout.createCheckoutSession({
     title: file.title,
     description: file.summary,
     amount: priceInCents, // e.g., 500 = $5.00
     currency: "USD",
     success_url: "https://your-app.vercel.app/dashboard?checkout=success",
     cancel_url: "https://your-app.vercel.app/dashboard?checkout=cancelled",
     metadata: {
       fileId: file.id,
       purchaserId: user.id,
       ownerId: file.ownerId
     }
   });
   ```

3. **User Redirected to Whop Checkout**
   - User completes payment on Whop's hosted checkout page
   - Whop processes payment securely

4. **Webhook Notification Received**
   - Whop sends `payment.succeeded` event to `/api/whop/webhook`
   - Webhook verified using HMAC signature
   - Transaction recorded in database
   - Revenue splits calculated and applied
   - Creator earnings updated
   - Notifications sent

5. **User Redirected Back to App**
   - User returned to success/cancel URL
   - Access granted to premium content

---

## Webhook Events

### Supported Events

#### `payment.succeeded`
Triggered when a user successfully completes payment.

**Payload:**
```json
{
  "type": "payment.succeeded",
  "data": {
    "id": "pay_xxxxx",
    "amount": 500,
    "currency": "USD",
    "metadata": {
      "fileId": "clxxx...",
      "purchaserId": "clxxx...",
      "ownerId": "clxxx..."
    }
  }
}
```

**Actions:**
- Increment `File.totalPurchases`
- Create `Transaction` record with revenue splits
- Update `User.earnings` for creator
- Send purchase notification email
- Grant access to premium content

#### `membership.created`
Triggered when a user creates a membership (subscription).

**Use Case:** Can be used for subscription-based access to content bundles or entire projects.

---

## Revenue Split Calculation

**Unchanged from Stripe implementation:**

| Party | Percentage | Example ($5.00 purchase) |
|-------|------------|-------------------------|
| Creator | 89% | $4.45 |
| Community Pool | 10% | $0.50 |
| Platform | 1% | $0.05 |

**Stored in Transaction record:**
```typescript
{
  amount: 5.00,
  creatorShare: 4.45,
  communityShare: 0.50,
  platformShare: 0.05,
  currency: "USD"
}
```

---

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Configure Whop App for Payments

**Whop Dashboard → Your App → Settings**

1. Enable "Payments" feature
2. Configure payment settings:
   - Supported currencies: USD (add others as needed)
   - Payment methods: Credit card, etc.
3. Review Whop's fee structure
4. Set up payout account (Whop handles creator payouts)

### 2. Configure Webhook Endpoint

**Whop Dashboard → Your App → Webhooks**

```
Webhook URL: https://your-deployment.vercel.app/api/whop/webhook
Events to listen for:
  ✓ payment.succeeded
  ✓ membership.created (optional)
Signing Secret: (copy and save as WHOP_SIGNING_SECRET)
```

### 3. Update Environment Variables

**Local Development:**
```bash
# Verify these variables in .env.local
WHOP_SERVER_API_KEY="whop_api_key_xxxxx"
WHOP_SIGNING_SECRET="whop_webhook_signing_secret"
```

**Vercel Production:**
1. Navigate to Project Settings → Environment Variables
2. Verify `WHOP_SERVER_API_KEY` is set (Production environment)
3. Add/update `WHOP_SIGNING_SECRET` with webhook signing secret
4. Remove old Stripe variables if present

### 4. Deploy Updated Code

```bash
# Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "Migrate from Stripe to Whop integrated payments"
git push origin main

# Vercel will auto-deploy
# Or manually trigger: vercel --prod
```

### 5. Test Payment Flow

**Test in Development:**
```bash
npm run dev
# Visit http://localhost:3000
```

**Test Steps:**
1. Create a test file and toggle to Premium
2. Set price (e.g., $5.00)
3. Click "Purchase" button
4. Should redirect to Whop checkout
5. Complete test payment (use Whop test mode if available)
6. Verify redirect back to app
7. Check database for Transaction record
8. Verify creator earnings updated
9. Check for notification email (if Resend configured)

---

## Webhook Testing

### Using Whop CLI (if available)

```bash
# Forward webhooks to local dev
whop webhooks forward --url http://localhost:3000/api/whop/webhook

# Trigger test event
whop webhooks trigger payment.succeeded
```

### Manual Testing

**Using curl:**
```bash
# Generate test signature
SECRET="your_whop_signing_secret"
PAYLOAD='{"type":"payment.succeeded","data":{"id":"pay_test","amount":500}}'
SIGNATURE=$(echo -n "$PAYLOAD" | openssl dgst -sha256 -hmac "$SECRET" -binary | xxd -p)

# Send webhook
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/whop/webhook \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-whop-signature: $SIGNATURE" \
  -d "$PAYLOAD"
```

### Verify Webhook Logs

**Vercel Dashboard → Deployment → Functions → `/api/whop/webhook`**

Look for:
- ✅ Signature verification passed
- ✅ Event type recognized
- ✅ Transaction created
- ✅ Earnings updated
- ✅ Notification sent

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Webhook Signature Validation Fails

**Error:** `Invalid signature`

**Solutions:**
1. Verify `WHOP_SIGNING_SECRET` matches Whop dashboard
2. Check webhook payload is sent as raw body (not parsed JSON)
3. Ensure signature header is `x-whop-signature`
4. Test signature generation locally:
```javascript
const crypto = require('crypto');
const secret = process.env.WHOP_SIGNING_SECRET;
const body = JSON.stringify(webhookPayload);
const signature = crypto.createHmac('sha256', secret).update(body).digest('hex');
console.log('Expected signature:', signature);
```

### Issue: Checkout Session Creation Fails

**Error:** `Whop is not configured`

**Solutions:**
1. Verify `WHOP_SERVER_API_KEY` is set
2. Check API key has correct permissions (checkout.create)
3. Verify Whop app has payments enabled
4. Check Whop SDK version: `npm list @whop/api`

### Issue: User Not Found in Checkout

**Error:** `Purchaser not found or not authenticated with Whop`

**Solutions:**
1. User must be authenticated through Whop iframe
2. Verify `User.whopUserId` is populated
3. Check Whop authentication flow in `lib/auth/session.ts`
4. Ensure user syncing is working correctly

### Issue: Payment Succeeds but Transaction Not Created

**Error:** Transaction not found in database after payment

**Solutions:**
1. Check webhook is receiving events (Vercel logs)
2. Verify metadata is included in checkout session
3. Check webhook handler for errors
4. Manually verify webhook endpoint is reachable
5. Review Whop webhook delivery logs in dashboard

---

---

## Database Schema (Unchanged)

The `Transaction` model remains the same:

```prisma
model Transaction {
  id                 String   @id @default(cuid())
  fileId             String
  creatorId          String
  purchaserId        String
  amount             Decimal
  currency           String   @default("USD")
  creatorShare       Decimal  @default(0)
  communityShare     Decimal  @default(0)
  platformShare      Decimal  @default(0)
  externalReference  String?  @unique  // Now stores Whop payment ID
  createdAt          DateTime @default(now())

  file      File @relation(fields: [fileId], references: [id])
  creator   User @relation("CreatorTransactions", fields: [creatorId], references: [id])
  purchaser User @relation("PurchaserTransactions", fields: [purchaserId], references: [id])
}
```

**Key:** `externalReference` now stores Whop payment ID (e.g., `pay_xxxxx`) instead of Stripe session ID.

---

## API Reference

### Create Checkout Session

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/checkout`

**Request:**
```json
{
  "fileId": "clxxx..."
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "url": "https://whop.com/checkout/session_xxxxx",
  "id": "session_xxxxx"
}
```

**Frontend Usage:**
```typescript
const response = await fetch('/api/checkout', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ fileId: 'clxxx...' })
});

const { url } = await response.json();
window.location.href = url; // Redirect to Whop checkout
```
